Description
A Python keylogger that captures and logs every keystroke to a file using the pynput library.

Explanation
This script listens for key presses on the keyboard and logs each key to a file named key_log.txt. It uses the pynput library to monitor key events, logging regular characters as well as special keys. The keylogger runs until the Esc key is pressed, which stops the listener and ends the logging process.


1)Install the pynput library using pip: pip install pynput

2)Run the program: python keylogger.py

3)The program will record keystrokes and save them to a file called key_log.txt. Note: The program will stop logging when the Esc key is pressed.

AN EXAMPLE .txt file has been uploaded in the repository.
